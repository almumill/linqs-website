We are the LINQS Statistical Relational Learning Group.
Our group develops tools to solve large, structured, and heterogeneous problems.

We focus on statistical relational learning, probabilistic reasoning and scalable inference,
and their applications to problems in computational social science, knowledge discovery, data mining, and computational biology.
On the theoretical side, we introduce new theory and algorithms for efficient reasoning, learning, and inference.
On the practical side, we apply our methods on a range of applications including user modelling, explainable recommender systems, and social good.

The LINQS (**L**iseâ€™s **INQ**uisitive **S**tudents) group at UCSC is directed by Professor [Lise Getoor](https://getoor.soe.ucsc.edu/).
